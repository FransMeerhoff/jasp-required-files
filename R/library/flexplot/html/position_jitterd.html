<h2>Jitter points based on density to avoid overplotting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Counterintuitively adding random noise to a plot can sometimes make it
easier to read. Jittering is particularly useful for small datasets with
at least one discrete position. Jittering based on density ensures that
the amount of random noise only increases as the probability of overlap
increases.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
position_jitterd(width = NULL, height = NULL, quad.points = 100,
  seed = NA)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width, height</code></td>
<td>
<p>Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter
is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread
is twice the value specified here. However, that amount of jittering depends
on the density. The location of highest density in the dataset will have 
jittering equal to the amount the user specifies, otherwise, jittering is a 
fraction of that. 
</p>
<p>If omitted, defaults to 40% of the resolution of the data: this means the
jitter values will occupy 80% of the implied bins for the highest density. Categorical data
is aligned on the integers, so a width or height of 0.5 will spread the
data so it's not possible to see the distinction between the categories.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>quad.points</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of &quot;quadriture points&quot; for the density function. 
Higher numbers yield a more detailed jittered density plot</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>A random seed to make the jitter reproducible.
Useful if you need to apply the same jitter twice, e.g., for a point and
a corresponding label.
The random seed is reset after jittering.
If 'NA' (the default value), the seed is initialised with a random value;
this makes sure that two subsequent calls start with a different seed.
Use 'NULL' to use the current random seed and also avoid resetting
(the behaviour of <span class="pkg">ggplot</span> 2.2.1 and earlier).</p>
